# Introduction

This page contains our plans for this project which are not the current ones.

## [YAML-based syntax](https://github.com/command-line-interface-pages/syntax/pull/37)

We think that it's better not to extend Markdown with some brand new unknown
syntax, but instead use YAML for writing pages. Now we're supporting
Markdown-like syntax, but later we are planning to migrate all pages to YAML to
be able to
provide more details for pages and make it easier to write them.

We noticed some issues with the current syntax which will be addressed in
[YAML-based](https://github.com/command-line-interface-pages/syntax/pull/37)
syntax.
