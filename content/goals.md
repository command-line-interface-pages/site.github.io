# Introduction :information_source:

This page contains the current goals we wanna archive in our project. The main
task now is to make all tools, pages and themes support
[v2.7.0 syntax][syntax].

## [CLI pages][cli-pages] :books:

Now we are focused on updating and adding missing coreutils pages. We aiming to
refresh them to make them more user-friendly. For instance to enable long/short
option support, add auto-generated examples for getting command help/version and
more.

## [Directory pages][directory-pages] :books:

It's a one of brand new repos out there. So at the first place we need just to
fill it with useful content based on
[Filesystem Hierarchy Standard][fhs].
