# Contributing guide

## Prerequisites

### Visual Studio Code

- [common extensions](https://command-line-interface-pages.github.io/site.github.io/extensions/)
- YAML:
  - [YAML (linter, formatter, intellisence, snippets)](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=redhat.vscode-yaml)  
    If you prefer [GitHub Actions](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.vscode-github-actions) extension over this one, it's possible
    to disable YAML extension for workflow files via:

    ```json
    {
      "yaml.schemas": {
        "schemas/empty.json": ".github/workflows/*.yaml"
      }
    }
    ```

    where **empty.json** is a schema with:

    ```json
    {}
    ```

    content.

- Hugo:
  - [Hugo Language and Syntax Support (snippets, highlighting)](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=redhat.vscode-yaml)
