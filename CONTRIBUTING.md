# Contributing guide

## Prerequisites

### Visual Studio Code

- YAML:
  - [YAML (IntelliSence)](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=redhat.vscode-yaml)
- commit messages:
  - [commitlint (Linter)](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=joshbolduc.commitlint)

## How to get started?

Before writing your own pages try to explore existing ones with preinstalled
prerequisites. Start with the [simplest](./content/goals.md) one.

### How to add a repository to the home page?

Public repositories are not listed automatically based on our organization.
It's manually chosen what to show and what not. To add a new repository to
the repository list:

- Open [`data/repositories.yaml`](./data/repositories.yaml) file
- Add a new array item like:

    ```yaml
    - name: cli-pages
      description: Command Line Interface (CLI) pages
    ```

### How to add a similar project to the project page?

To add a new similar project to the project list:

- Open [`data/projects.yaml`](./data/projects.yaml) file
- Add a new array item like:

    ```yaml
    - name: eg
      description: Useful examples at the command line
      url: https://github.com/srsudar/eg
    ```

### How to add a common extension to the extension page?

To add a new common extension to the extension list:

- Open [`data/extensions.yaml`](./data/extensions.yaml) file
- Add a new object like:

  ```yaml
  Commit messages:
    commitlint:
      description: A VS Code extension that integrates commitlint
      url: https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=joshbolduc.commitlint
      type: [linter]
  ```

### How else can I help?

Now we don't have anybody in organization who understands HTML, CSS and
JavaScript and willing to close [opened issues][issues]
related to these languages. If you are an open-source contributor and want to
help us, go ahead and make PR. ðŸ˜„

Thanks!
