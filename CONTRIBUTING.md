# Contributing guide

## Prerequisites

### Visual Studio Code

- [common extensions](https://command-line-interface-pages.github.io/site.github.io/extensions/)
- Hugo:
  - [Hugo Language and Syntax Support (snippets, highlighting)](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=redhat.vscode-yaml)

## How to get started?

Before writing your own pages try to explore existing ones with preinstalled
prerequisites. Start with the [simplest](./content/goals.md) one.

### How to add a repository to the [home page][home]?

Public repositories are not listed automatically based on our organization.
It's manually chosen what to show and what not. To add a new repository to
the repository list:

- Open [`data/repositories.yaml`](./data/repositories.yaml) file
- Add a new array item like:

  ```yaml
  cli-pages: # A repository
    description: Command Line Interface (CLI) pages
  ```

[home]: https://command-line-interface-pages.github.io/site.github.io/

### How to add a similar project to the [project page][projects]?

To add a new similar project to the project list:

- Open [`data/projects.yaml`](./data/projects.yaml) file
- Add a new array item like:

  ```yaml
  eg: # A similar project
    description: Useful examples at the command line
    url: https://github.com/srsudar/eg
  ```

[projects]: https://command-line-interface-pages.github.io/site.github.io/projects/

### How to add a common extension to the [extension page][extensions]?

To add a new common extension to the extension list:

- Open [`data/extensions.yaml`](./data/extensions.yaml) file
- Add a new object like:

  ```yaml
  Commit messages: # An extension category
    commitlint: # A common extension
      description: A VS Code extension that integrates commitlint
      url: https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=joshbolduc.commitlint
      type: [linter]
  ```

[extensions]: https://command-line-interface-pages.github.io/site.github.io/extensions/

### How else can I help?

Now we don't have anybody in organization who understands HTML, CSS and
JavaScript and willing to close [opened issues][issues]
related to these languages. If you are an open-source contributor and want to
help us, go ahead and make PR. ðŸ˜„

Thanks!
